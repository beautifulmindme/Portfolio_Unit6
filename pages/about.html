        The University of Michigan Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) Program (www.wise.umich.edu) sponsors two Girls Who Code clubs at of Fall 2016. Our goal is to help others in communities outside of the Ann Arbor area to set up their own CWC clubs, but right now, we are still figuring things out.

Girls Who Code is a national nonprofit organization aimed at increasing the numbers of girls in computer science majors through summer program and school-year clubs. The national organization supplies an interface, curriculum and a web page to register a club so that students and potential instructors can find each other. Club sponsors supply location, technology, and if needed instructors. Sponsors also arrange for speakers and field trips. if they can find their own funding, they purchase tshirts.
